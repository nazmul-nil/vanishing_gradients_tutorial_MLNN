# Understanding and Addressing Vanishing and Exploding Gradients in Deep Learning

This repository provides a tutorial to understand and address the **vanishing gradient problem** in deep learning. It includes practical solutions, such as using ReLU activation functions, proper weight initialization, and batch normalization, all demonstrated with TensorFlow.

## üìñ Overview

Deep neural networks often face **vanishing gradients**, where gradient values diminish during backpropagation, leading to ineffective training. This tutorial:
- Explains the vanishing gradient problem and its impact on deep learning.
- Demonstrates methods to diagnose and visualize gradient flow.
- Provides practical solutions to address this issue.
